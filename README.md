As soon as we started working on the Design Document for this assignment,we realized that this was going to be a very challenging assignment. In 
particular, we struggled a lot with the bitpacking aspect for both Part A and Part B of the 
assignment because we had trouble grasping the concept due to it being our first 
encounter with the topic. It took us attending help hours and re-reading the assignment 
multiple times for us to finally get a grasp on what this assignment is talking about. 
Because we had trouble understanding and grasping the concepts of this assignment it 
took us a while to be able to create a design document with the functions and proper 
steps that we needed to make. While attempting to create the Design Document, we 
attended help hours hosted by Professor Daniels as well as the TA’s, Eddy and Najib. 
We spent most of the week in help hours getting help on our design document and 
asking questions to clarify what functions we would need and if the way we wanted to 
implement them was correct. Another thing that we struggled with in our Design 
Document was specifying the modules that we would be using in the implementations of 
our Image Compression and Bitpack programs. While we thought that we had done this 
it turned out that we didn’t have the correct idea of what was wanted and therefore lost 
points on that. Another struggle that we faced for the design document bit was that 
Amelia was stuck in Scotland with covid and because the time difference it made it 
difficult for all of us to meet up together on zoom all the time. However, we were able to 
find a way to work together, where if one of us couldn't attend hours or something like 
that the other two went and then filled in the missing person. Sometimes Amelia and 
Lakshinee would be on hours or Amelia and Yusra or Yusra and Lakshinee but we all 
found time to help out and all worked on it together.
For the actual implementation of the code we had some trouble because what we 
had for some of our functions ended up being too complicated and did not work properly 
so we had to redo and restructure everything but in the end we were able to get it to 
work. We probably spent almost 15-20 hours on this assignment being in and out of 
help hours all week to try and get our code to work properly and output what was 
needed. We attended Professor Daniels hours, Colins, Eddys, and asked questions on 
edstem all week and through the weekend. Instead of having all of our code in one file 
we have split it up into different rs files that are then called when needed. We have a 
bitpack file, codec file, compVid file , dct file, floatingPt file, inOutArr file, Lib and Main 
file, Trim file, and Types file that each do their own specific things. This made it so that 
we don't have hundreds of lines of code on one file that we have to scroll through and 
allowed for better organization. I think that overall while this assignment was hard and 
took us a while to complete, we all worked on it together and were able to attend the 
hours we needed and get the necessary help to finish the assignment and meet the 
needed requirements.
